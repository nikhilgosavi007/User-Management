# UserManagement

This is a work in progress application that aimed to build a user management application.
Although incomplete, at the moment list of users and list of groups are displayed with 
the help of dummy services.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
